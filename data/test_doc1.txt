What is cognitive debt?

Cognitive debt refers to the accumulation of unprocessed knowledge that results from over-reliance on shortcuts like generative AI, notes, or search engines without true understanding. Students may recall answers without grasping underlying concepts, which can harm problem-solving and long-term retention.

Why is cognitive debt a problem?

In educational contexts, cognitive debt undermines deep learning and critical thinking. Studies from MIT and Stanford have shown that overusing tools like ChatGPT can lead to decreased performance on conceptual exams.

How can AI reduce cognitive debt?

AI systems that guide users instead of giving direct answers can help reduce cognitive debt. These systems promote metacognition, gently redirect thinking, and scaffold students through their own learning process.

What is retrieval-augmented generation?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines a large language model (LLM) with a knowledge retriever. Rather than relying solely on its training, the LLM can query an external database or knowledge source to pull in relevant context before generating a response.

How does our AI Tutor use RAG?

The AI Tutor uses RAG to fetch context from instructor-provided course material. When a student asks a question, the model retrieves relevant sections and then generates a guided response tailored to that studentâ€™s learning style.
